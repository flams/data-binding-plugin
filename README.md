Data binding
=============

One of the most powerful two-way data-binding tools available. It has a bunch of really cool features:

- It can be extended with plugins so that virtually any behavior can be triggered on model update.
- It can generate DOM elements for you based on a pure HTML template and repeat them to render a list of items.
- The rendering of lists of items can be virtualized so that not all of the items get rendered, improving performance and memory consumption.
- It's so fast that it's the perfect tool for mobile devices too.
- It's extensively tested to prevent memory leaks.
- It's really to use as it's a plugin for [Seam](https://github.com/flams/seam), which is the simplest way to attach behavior to an HTML template.
- It even works with SVGs!
